# Santiago Speech App

## This app helps Santiago communicate with his family. Santiago is ill and cannot speak. The goal of this app is to help him communicate with his family in spanish. 

### The way this app works is there is illustrations and words/phrases under each image. When the words/phrases are clicked on, a voice comes over the device speaker and speaks the word/phrase out loud. There are many scenerios and even images of family members to help him communicate as much as possible.

### Hope this app can not only help Santiago but cane help many others that may have a loved one that cant commuicate with others.

### Thank you
